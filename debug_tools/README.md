# Minecraft Debug Tools

This sample contains a set of simple debug tools for adding in-game and editor watches.

## Prerequisites

**Install Node.js tools, if you haven't already**

We're going to use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) to get more tools to make the process of building our project easier.

Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org).

Download the version with "LTS" next to the number and install it. (LTS stands for Long Term Support, if you're curious.) In the Node.js Windows installer, accept the installation defaults. You do not need to install any additional tools for Native compilation.

**Install Visual Studio Code, if you haven't already**

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

1. Use npm to install dependent modules:

   ```powershell
   npm i
   ```

1. Use this shortcut command to open the project in Visual Studio Code:

   ```powershell
   code .
   ```

### Running the parts of our project

Within the root folder (debug_tools) of this sample, run this command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Run this one to deploy in the game.

```powershell
npm run local-deploy
```

If you'd like to run deployment in a watch mode, run the following:

```powershell
npm run local-deploy -- --watch
```

Run this one to deploy in the editor mode.

```powershell
npm run local-deploy-editor
```
