# Resource Pack Sample

This sample is the resource pack used in the Intro to Resource Packs Tutorial.

See the [Intro to Resource Packs](https://docs.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/documents/resourcepack) documentation for the full walkthrough creating an aggressive cow using a resource pack.

### Locate the com.mojang folder

1. Copy and paste the following into the Open field: `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`
1. Click OK.

### Copy Resource Pack sample into the `com.mojang` folder

1. Click `development_resource_packs`.
1. Copy `resource_pack_sample` into the folder.

### Enable the Resource Pack in Minecraft

1. Launch Minecraft and select Play.
1. Select Create New World.

Your plain dirt blocks are now bright green. Neat!
