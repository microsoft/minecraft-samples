The main purpose of the Chill Dreams Add-On is to support a hands free" mode where Minecraft will fly over your terrain and show you amazing sites within your Minecraft world. The focal point is this "dream mode". But it's also a gameplay element inside of Minecraft.

## Dream Turkey Mob

The Dream Turkey is a new mob that will spawn throughout the world:

If you cause a dream turkey to no longer be alive, it should randomly output two ingerdients:
* Raw Dream Turkey and Dream Essence.

Raw dream turkey can be placed into a furnace. This will create cooked dream turkey.

## Dream Mode

When a player eats cooked dream turkey, this will cause the player to fall asleep and enter dream mode. Dream mode will cause the player to fly over random parts of the landscape. At the start of a dream, the player can also select different types of dreams:
 
* Around your memories means that dream mode will fly around your memory jars
* Around random places means that dream mode will fly around completely random places in the world.
* Nightmares means that dream mode will fly around random places in the nether.

If no option is selected, the player will just fly around locations close to where they fell asleep.

A player can Sprint to exit out of dream mode.


## Dream Essence
 
Dream essence is used as an ingredient in several craftable items:
* Dream Pencil
* Dream essence, combined with two brown concrete and two sticks in the following formation:

Create the dream pencil.  The Dream Pencil is used to edit nearby "memories", which have a name.
 
When you create a memory using the pencil, this places a "memory jar" as a visual guide to where memories are placed:

These memories are used to act as waypoints for the dream mode. For example, if you wanted dream mode to fly by your awesome creations, like a castle, you would put a nearby memory jar, called "Castle", and then in the dream mode â€“ if you have select "around your memories", it would fly near the castle.

## Dream Journal

The Dream Journal can be built using paper, leather, and dream essence.
 
The Dream Journal lets you revisit your memories, fairly quickly, to allow for quick navigation.
 

## Prerequisites

### Install Node.js tools, if you haven't already

We're going to use the Node Package Manager (or NPM) to get more tools to make the process of building our project easier.

Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org).

Download the version with "LTS" next to the number and install it.

### Install Visual Studio Code, if you haven't already

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started


1. Using a copy of this starter project from GitHub - you can get a copy of this project by visiting [https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples/](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples/) and, under the Code button, selecting `Download ZIP`.

1. The `casual_creator/chill_dreams` folder contains different stages of the chill dreams project for Minecraft. Use the subfolder of the phase you want to start with.

1. To make your own environment look like the example, create a folder on your `C:\` drive and call it **projects**. Create a subfolder called **myaddon**.

1. Put the extracted contents of the Add-on Starter Project folder into **myaddon**.

1. Open a Windows Terminal or PowerShell window and change the working directory to your **myaddon** folder:

    ```powershell
    cd c:\projects\myaddon\
    ```

1. Use NPM to install our tools:

    ```powershell
    npm i
    ```

1. Use this shortcut command to open the project in Visual Studio Code:

    ```powershell
    code .
    ```

It might also ask you to install the Minecraft Debugger and Blockception's Visual Studio Code plugin, which are plugins to Visual Studio Code that can help with Minecraft development. Go ahead and do that, if you haven't already.

### Summary

Chill Dreams demonstrates several techniques for building a thematic Add-On in Minecraft. Please view the series on [the Minecraft Creator Learning Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/casual) for more info.
